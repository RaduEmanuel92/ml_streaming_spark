Autodata Scientist Game

1. Producer selects random data set, trains logistic regression on it and sends it to Kafka together with the accuracy score.

2. Consumer receives, tries to beat data set.
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

while True:
    # make_classification
    # train logreg
    # score it
    # send dataset combined with score via the producer to test-topic
    # sleep(0.5)

# 1. X, y = make_classification(flip_y=0.1)
# 2. train logistic regression on X, y
# 3. send data set with score (= accuracy of that model on the data) via kafka
